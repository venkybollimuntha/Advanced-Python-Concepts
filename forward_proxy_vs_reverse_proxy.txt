Forward proxy vs Reverse Proxy:
-------------------------------

Forward proxy:
-------------

it's actually on the client side, all the client requests are go to proxy server and then to internet.

In this way server doesn't know the actual client IP address, it(server) knows only the proxy server address

Forward proxies are typically used internally by large organizations, such as universities and enterprises
	1. Block employees from visiting certain websites
	2. Monitor employee online activity
	3. Improve the user experience by caching external site content

Eg: VPN


Reverse Proxy:(Load balancer)
--------------

It's actually located on the server side, just before the servers, it distributes the incoming requests to all the servers and return response to client side.

Connecting with the origin server and forwarding the original request
Completing a TCP three-way handshake, terminating the initial connection


eg. load balancer


Reverse proxy software for HTTP
1. Apache
